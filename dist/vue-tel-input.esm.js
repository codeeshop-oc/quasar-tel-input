// For some reason Google's metadata contains `<intlFormat/>`s with brackets and dashes.
// Meanwhile, there's no single opinion about using punctuation in international phone numbers.
//
// For example, Google's `<intlFormat/>` for USA is `+1 213-373-4253`.
// And here's a quote from WikiPedia's "North American Numbering Plan" page:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan
//
// "The country calling code for all countries participating in the NANP is 1.
// In international format, an NANP number should be listed as +1 301 555 01 00,
// where 301 is an area code (Maryland)."
//
// I personally prefer the international format without any punctuation.
// For example, brackets are remnants of the old age, meaning that the
// phone number part in brackets (so called "area code") can be omitted
// if dialing within the same "area".
// And hyphens were clearly introduced for splitting local numbers into memorizable groups.
// For example, remembering "5553535" is difficult but "555-35-35" is much simpler.
// Imagine a man taking a bus from home to work and seeing an ad with a phone number.
// He has a couple of seconds to memorize that number until it passes by.
// If it were spaces instead of hyphens the man wouldn't necessarily get it,
// but with hyphens instead of spaces the grouping is more explicit.
// I personally think that hyphens introduce visual clutter,
// so I prefer replacing them with spaces in international numbers.
// In the modern age all output is done on displays where spaces are clearly distinguishable
// so hyphens can be safely replaced with spaces without losing any legibility.

// formatted but AYTF should retain all the number entered and not change
// in order to match a format (of same leading digits and length) display
// in that way."

// safe to return this in formatted number as nothing is lost / added."
// Otherwise, don't use this format.

      // "Dialing a Mexican cell phone from abroad
      // When you are calling a cell phone number in Mexico from outside Mexico,
      // it’s necessary to dial an additional “1” after Mexico’s country code
      // (which is “52”) and before the area code.
      // You also ignore the 045, and simply dial the area code and the
      // cell phone’s number.
      //
      // If you don’t add the “1”, you’ll receive a recorded announcement
      // asking you to redial using it.
      //
      // For example, if you are calling from the USA to a cell phone
      // in Mexico City, you would dial +52 – 1 – 55 – 1234 5678.
      // (Note that this is different to calling a land line in Mexico City
      // from abroad, where the number dialed would be +52 – 55 – 1234 5678)".
